## Technical Details

### Scoring System
```python
OPTION_SCORES = [0, 1, 2, 4, 8]  # Exponential progression
MAX_POINTS_PER_QUESTION = 8
```

### State Management
```python
ASSESSMENT_PHASE = "assessment"
RESULTS_PHASE = "results"

# Session State Variables
- phase: Current application phase
- responses: User's question responses
- scores: Calculated scores
- email: User's email (results phase)
```

### Styling
```python
# Chart Colors
CHART_COLORS = {
    'current': {
        'fill': 'rgba(52, 152, 219, 0.5)',
        'stroke': 'rgb(52, 152, 219)'
    },
    'previous': {
        'fill': 'rgba(46, 204, 113, 0.3)',
        'stroke': 'rgb(46, 204, 113)'
    }
}
```
