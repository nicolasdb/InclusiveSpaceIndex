# Making spaces more inclusive: a journey-based framework

## The challenge
Creating truly inclusive spaces is complex. Many communities want to become more welcoming but struggle with where to start, how to measure progress, or how to maintain momentum. Traditional assessment tools often feel overwhelming, disconnected from real community experiences, or fail to acknowledge the unique challenges each space faces.

## Our approach
Instead of presenting a rigid checklist, we've designed a framework that treats inclusion as a journey of continuous improvement. By combining practical assessment tools with community engagement mechanics, we create a path that is both meaningful and engaging.

## Key principles
- **Progress Over Perfection**: Every step toward inclusion matters
- **Community-Driven**: Learning from each other's successes and challenges
- **Engaging Process**: Making inclusion work feel achievable and rewarding
- **Flexible Implementation**: Adapting to each space's unique context
- **Sustainable Change**: Building habits that last

## The journey
Our framework guides spaces through four levels of inclusion maturity, each building on the previous:

### Starting out
Begin with fundamental aspects of accessibility and welcome. Early wins build confidence and momentum, while community challenges help spaces connect and learn from each other.

### Building foundations
Develop systematic approaches to inclusion, supported by peer learning and practical challenges that demonstrate real progress.

### Deepening practice
Expand inclusion work across all aspects of community life, with opportunities to mentor other spaces and contribute to the broader inclusion movement.

### Leading change
Become a beacon of inclusive practice, sharing insights and innovations that help the whole community grow.

## Innovations in our approach
- **Progressive achievement**: Breaking down overwhelming tasks into achievable steps
- **Community validation**: Moving beyond self-assessment to peer learning
- **Engaging mechanics**: Making inclusion work more visible and rewarding
- **Flexible pathways**: Acknowledging that each space's journey is unique

## Common challenges and solutions
We recognize that spaces face various obstacles in their inclusion journey. Our framework addresses these through:
- Multiple pathways to demonstrate progress
- Peer support and resource sharing
- Celebrations of small wins
- Focus on practical, impactful changes
