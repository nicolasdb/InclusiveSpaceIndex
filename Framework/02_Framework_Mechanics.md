# Making inclusion work engaging: framework mechanics

## Core engagement design

Our framework builds on fundamental human motivations to make inclusion work both meaningful and engaging. We understand that creating inclusive spaces isn't just about checking boxes - it's about building communities where everyone can thrive. Here's how we make that journey engaging and sustainable:

## The heart of engagement

At the core of our framework are three interconnected loops that keep communities engaged and moving forward:

The Assessment & Discovery loop turns self-reflection into an engaging journey of discovery. Spaces start with simple self-assessment tasks, gradually uncovering new aspects of inclusion as they progress. Each discovery leads to new insights, while visible progress tracking and celebration of small wins maintain momentum.

The Community Connection loop transforms individual effort into shared growth. Through our buddy system, spaces connect with peers on similar journeys, sharing experiences and validating each other's progress. These relationships provide support, accountability, and inspiration, making the journey less solitary and more enriching.

The Innovation & Sharing loop encourages spaces to move beyond standard solutions. As communities encounter unique challenges, they develop creative approaches that can benefit others. By documenting and sharing these innovations, spaces contribute to a growing body of practical inclusion knowledge.

## The journey of growth

Every inclusive space starts somewhere. Our framework recognizes that creating welcoming communities is a journey of continuous growth, with each level building upon the foundations laid before.

### Beginning the journey
Your first steps focus on the essentials of creating a welcoming space. Here, you'll explore basic accessibility and inclusion through practical, achievable goals. Working with five key areas - from physical accessibility to welcome practices - you'll build confidence through small victories and connect with a buddy space for support and encouragement. This is where you'll discover that even simple changes can have meaningful impact.

### Growing together
As your confidence grows, so does your impact. In this phase, you'll move beyond individual actions to develop systematic approaches to inclusion. Your space becomes a living laboratory for inclusive practices, engaging more deeply with your community and contributing to a shared resource library. You'll start seeing patterns, understanding root causes, and developing more sophisticated solutions to inclusion challenges.

### Leading by example
This is where your space transforms from participant to guide. Your experiences - both successes and challenges - become valuable learning opportunities for others. You'll take on mentorship roles, create resources that help other spaces on their journeys, and develop innovative approaches to persistent challenges. Your impact extends beyond your own walls as you help shape the broader conversation about inclusive spaces.

### Shaping the future
At this transformative level, your space becomes a beacon of inclusion, driving systemic change across the maker community. You're not just implementing best practices - you're creating them. Your innovative approaches to inclusion challenges influence industry standards, while your leadership helps shape a future where truly inclusive spaces are the norm, not the exception.

## Community activation

The power of our framework lies in its community-driven nature. Through the buddy system, spaces are matched with peers based on complementary strengths and challenges. These partnerships foster regular check-ins, shared challenges, and combined celebrations, creating a supportive ecosystem for growth.

Knowledge flows naturally through the community through success stories, shared solutions, and collaborative problem-solving. As spaces progress, they take on different roles - from learner to mentor, from participant to leader - creating a rich, sustainable community of practice.

## Supporting progress

To help spaces maintain momentum, we've integrated several support mechanisms. For those just starting, we provide clear templates and examples, helping identify quick wins that build confidence. Regular reminders and community updates keep engagement high, while achievement sharing celebrates progress and inspires others.

As spaces deepen their engagement, new opportunities emerge: mentorship roles, leadership positions, special projects, and community recognition. These opportunities provide natural pathways for continued growth and impact.

## Measuring success

Success in inclusion work takes many forms. For individual spaces, it might be documented improvements, positive community feedback, or evidence of implemented changes. At the community level, success appears in active partnerships, new resources created, knowledge shared, and collective progress toward more inclusive spaces.

## Guiding principles

Our framework is built on four core principles that shape how we approach engagement and community development:
- **Making Progress Visible** emphasizes the power of transparency and awareness. Through clear tracking, regular updates, and celebration points, spaces can see their growth and impact, fostering accountability and inspiration.
- **Keeping It Natural** ensures that our work remains authentic and grounded. All mechanics support spaces' genuine goals, focusing on real impact rather than artificial targets. This approach ensures that inclusion work remains meaningful and deeply rooted in community values.
- **Building Community** recognizes that we are stronger together. Every aspect of the framework encourages peer support, shared learning, and collective achievement, while honoring and supporting each space's individual journey and contributions.
- **Maintaining Flexibility** acknowledges the unique nature of every space and community. By offering multiple paths, adaptable timing, and room for custom approaches, we ensure that inclusion work can be sustained and evolved to meet changing community needs.

Remember: These mechanics aren't about adding artificial game elements to inclusion work. They're about making the natural journey of creating inclusive spaces more engaging, sustainable, and community-driven.
