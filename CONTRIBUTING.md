## Ground Rules

To maintain a welcoming and productive community:

- Be kind and respectful in all interactions
- Value different perspectives and experiences
- Share learning from both successes and challenges
- Focus on making spaces more welcoming for everyone
- Support and encourage new contributors
- Be patient - inclusion work takes time

## Learning From Each Other

We believe that sharing our challenges is just as important as sharing our successes. Why?
- Real inclusion work is messy and complex
- Others might be facing similar challenges
- Failed attempts often teach us the most valuable lessons
- Being open about difficulties builds trust
- Solutions often emerge from shared struggles

When sharing your experiences, don't hesitate to include:
- Approaches that didn't work
- Unexpected challenges you faced
- How you adapted your plans
- What you learned from the process
- How it shaped your next steps
