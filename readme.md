# Inclusive Space Assessment Framework

## About
The Inclusive Space Assessment Framework is a gamified tool designed to help community spaces (such as makerspaces, fablabs, and other collective spaces) evaluate and improve their inclusivity practices. The framework uses progressive levels of achievement, peer validation, and community engagement to make the journey toward inclusion both structured and engaging.

## Project Structure
- `assessment-data.csv`: Core assessment questions and scoring criteria
- `level1-assessment.md`: Markdown version of the Level 1 assessment checklist
- `inclusion-engagement-framework.md`: Strategy document outlining gamification and engagement approaches

## Key Features
- Progressive difficulty levels (Novice to Proficient)
- Point-based scoring system (0-4 points per item)
- Gamification elements including:
  - Achievement gates between levels
  - Community challenges
  - Buddy system for peer support
  - Social proof mechanisms
- Structured around five core areas:
  1. Physical Accessibility
  2. Information and Communication
  3. Welcome and Orientation
  4. Basic Safety and Comfort
  5. Initial Inclusion Practices

## Upcoming Development
1. Web Implementation
   - Interactive assessment form
   - Automated scoring
   - Progress tracking
   - Community platform integration

2. Content Development
   - Level 2-4 assessment criteria
   - Additional challenge designs
   - Resource library
   - Best practices documentation

3. Community Features
   - Buddy system matching platform
   - Success story sharing
   - Peer review mechanisms
   - Community forum

4. Validation & Iteration
   - Pilot testing with spaces
   - Feedback collection
   - Metric validation
   - Framework refinement

## Usage
1. Start with Level 1 assessment
2. Score each item from 0-4 points
3. Complete level challenges
4. Connect with buddy spaces
5. Progress to next level when ready
