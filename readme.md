# Inclusive Space Assessment Framework

Creating inclusive spaces isn't just about checking boxesâ€”it's about building communities where everyone can thrive. This framework aim to helps community spaces (makerspaces, fablabs, and other collaborative environments) embark on a journey toward meaningful inclusion, making the process engaging, measurable, and community-driven.

## Why this matters?
Many spaces want to become more inclusive but struggle with where to start or how to measure progress. Traditional assessments can feel overwhelming or disconnecting. We believe that by making the journey interactive, progressive, and community-supported, we can help spaces create lasting positive change.

## Our approach
We combine practical assessment tools with engaging community mechanics to create a framework that:
- Makes inclusion progress tangible and measurable
- Breaks down overwhelming tasks into achievable steps
- Builds community support through peer connections
- Celebrates progress while encouraging growth
- Keeps the focus on practical, impactful changes

## Getting started
1. Begin your journey with our Level 1 assessment
2. Connect with other spaces on similar paths
3. Take on challenges that match your capacity
4. Progress at your own pace with community support

## Community
This is a community-driven project. We believe that inclusion work is stronger when we learn from each other. Join our growing network of spaces working toward positive change.

## Contributing

## Credits
This project builds upon the work of many community contributors and was inspired by architecture from [predecessor project name]. The assessment framework itself draws from real experiences in community spaces and incorporates gamification principles to make inclusion work more engaging and sustainable.
