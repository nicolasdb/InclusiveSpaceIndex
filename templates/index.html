            <p>Your first steps focus on the essentials of creating a welcoming space. Here, you'll explore basic accessibility and inclusion through practical, achievable goals.</p>
            
            <p>This isn't about achieving a perfect score - it's about honest reflection and identifying areas for growth. Each question is an opportunity to think deeply about your space and community.</p>
            
            <p>Before you begin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take your time to reflect honestly</li>
                <li>If you're unsure about a question, leave it blank - it's better than guessing</li>
                <li>Consider gathering input from different community members</li>
                <li>Remember: this is a starting point for growth, not a final judgment</li>
            </ul>
